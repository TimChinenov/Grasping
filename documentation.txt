Eigen Linear Algebra
--------------------
This needs to be filled out later

1) We placed the eigen folder into ../usr/include/eigen3

Boost.Python Set-up
--------------------
This documentation follows the following:
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

1) Download boost_1_67_0.tar.bz2, preferably into the Downloads folder

2) Navigate to the download folder, or the folder you placed the file

3) Navigate to the folder you want to place boost
(I am placing it in ../usr/include/)

4) Run command
sudo tar --bzip2 -xf ../../home/timmy/Downloads/boost_1_67_0.tar.bz2
Your path will differ by user name and where you placed your folder.

  (Things to keep in mind now...)
    -the root directory of boost is sometimes referred to as $BOOST_ROOT
    -To compile anything in boost, you need a directory containing the
      boost/subdirectory in your #include path
    -Include directives like:
      #include <boost/whatever.hpp>

5)  navigate to:
    cd path/to/boost_1_67_0

6) call ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/installation/prefix. (I used /usr/local)

7) run ./b2 install (If you're installing everything this may take some time >10min)

8) After installation, navigate too:
  /usr/include/boost_1_67_0/libs/python/example/quickstart

9) You will want to install bjam:
    sudo apt install libboost1.58-tools-dev

10) run bjam toolset=gcc --verbose-test test

10a) I additionally had to run sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev
---------------------------------------------


Need to somehow path the bjam to /boost/
